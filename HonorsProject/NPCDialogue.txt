Baking a cake can be a fun and rewarding experience. Here's a basic recipe and guide to help you get started:

Ingredients:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* Optional: flavorings such as nuts, chocolate chips, or fruit

Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven**: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe (usually 350°F or 180°C).
2. **Prepare your pans**: Grease two 8-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
3. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
4. **Cream butter and sugar**: In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter until it's light and fluffy. Gradually add granulated sugar and continue beating until well combined.
5. **Add eggs and vanilla**: Beat in the eggs one at a time, followed by vanilla extract.
6. **Alternate wet and dry ingredients**: With the mixer on low speed, alternate adding the flour mixture and milk (or buttermilk) to the butter mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Beat just until combined.
7. **Optional add-ins**: If using, fold in nuts, chocolate chips, or fruit into the batter.
8. **Divide the batter**: Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
9. **Bake**: Bake for 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
10. **Cool**: Remove from the oven and let cool in the pans for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Tips:

* Use room temperature ingredients for better mixing and texture.
* Don't overmix, as this can lead to dense cakes.
* Check your oven temperature with an oven thermometer to ensure accuracy.
* If you're using a convection oven, adjust the baking time and temperature accordingly.
* To ensure even baking, rotate the pans halfway through the baking time.

Common mistakes:

* Overmixing
* Incorrect oven temperature
* Insufficient greasing or parchment paper
* Opening the oven door too often during baking

Troubleshooting:

* Cake is dense: Check for overmixing and make sure to use room temperature ingredients.
* Cake is not rising: Make sure to not overmix, and check that your leavening agents (baking powder) are fresh.

Remember, practice makes perfect! Don't be discouraged if your first cake doesn't turn out as expected. Keep trying, and you'll soon become a pro at baking cakes.

Baking a cake is a fun and rewarding process that requires some basic ingredients, equipment, and technique. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

Equipment:

Instructions:

**Step 1: Preheat the Oven**

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Make sure to use an oven thermometer to ensure accurate temperature.

**Step 2: Prepare the Cake Pan**

Grease the baking pan with butter or cooking spray. If using parchment paper, cut it to fit the bottom and sides of the pan.

**Step 3: Mix Dry Ingredients**

In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

**Step 4: Cream Butter and Sugar**

In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer (or a whisk) to cream together butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

**Step 5: Beat in Eggs**

Beat in eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to fully incorporate before adding the next. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

**Step 6: Add Vanilla Extract**

Add vanilla extract and mix until combined.

**Step 7: Combine Dry Ingredients**

Gradually add the dry ingredients (flour mixture) to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined.

**Step 8: Add Optional Mix-ins (if using)**

Fold in any optional mix-ins, such as nuts or chocolate chips.

**Step 9: Pour Batter into Cake Pan**

Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top.

**Step 10: Bake the Cake**

Bake for 25-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Rotate the pan halfway through baking to ensure even cooking.

**Step 11: Cool the Cake**

Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.

Tips and Variations:

* Use room temperature ingredients for better mixing and texture.
* Don't overmix, as this can lead to a dense cake.
* Experiment with different flavor combinations, such as adding cocoa powder or using different extracts like almond or lemon.
* Try adding nuts, chocolate chips, or fruit to create unique textures and flavors.

Common Cake Types:

* Vanilla cake: a classic, simple cake made with vanilla extract
